    "Rule Summary:\n",
    "- The board has `N` characters.\n",
    "- Players choose a character as their own.\n",
    "- Players alternate turns.\n",
    "- At each turn, a player may:\n",
    "  - Make a specific guess about the opponent's character (correct = win, incorrect = lose).\n",
    "  - Ask a yes/no question to reduce the possible characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple Example:\n",
    "- The board has 4 characters.\n",
    "- Player one chooses to eliminate 2 characters; player two does the same.\n",
    "  - Bisecting the board should produce the fastest game.\n",
    "- Player one has two characters remaining. Player one can:\n",
    "  1. Choose to eliminate 1 character, then guess correctly on the next turn.\n",
    "  1. Guess a character at random, with a 50% chance of winning and a 50% chance of losing.\n",
    "- If player one chooses option #1, player two can:\n",
    "  1. Choose to eliminate 1 character, and lose when player one guesses correctly.\n",
    "  1. Guess a character at random, with a 50% chance of winning and a 50% chance of losing.\n",
    "- From player two's perspective, option #2 is clearly better.\n",
    "- Therefore, from player one's perspective, option #1 and option #2 have the same win probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any other approach besides bisecting the board should be inferior. For instance, let's assume that\n",
    "the player chooses to divide the board into `1` and `N-1` players. `1/N` of the time, the player can guess correctly on the next move. `(N-1)/N` of the time, the player has only eliminated one character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Example:\n",
    "- The board has 4 characters.\n",
    "- Player one chooses to eliminate 2 characters.\n",
    "- Player two choose to divide the board into 1, 3 characters\n",
    "  - 1/4 of the time, there will be 1 character left, and player two can guess correctly on the next turn.\n",
    "    - This forces player one into guessing one of the two remaining characters, winning 50% of the time.\n",
    "  - 3/4 of the time, there will be 3 characters left.\n",
    "    - Player one can proceed to eliminate 1 character, leaving only one remaining.\n",
    "    - To avoid losing, player two has to guess, with a 1/3 chance of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the alternative example, player two has a (1/4) * (1/2) + (3/4) * (1/3), or 3/8 chance of winning. This is less than the 50% from the first example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extended Example:\n",
    "- The board has 24 characters.\n",
    "- The first turn for each player reduces this to 12.\n",
    "- The second turn for each player reduces this to 6.\n",
    "- The third turn for each player reduces this to 3.\n",
    "- Player one then has a:\n",
    "  - 1/3 chance of forcing player two into a 1/3 guess: 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9\n",
    "  - 2/3 chance of leaving player two a choice:\n",
    "    - Eliminate a character, leaving a (1/3 * 1/2 + 2/3 * 1/2"
